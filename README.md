# scripts
This repo contains tools, projects, and work samples. Most of the work I've done is proprietary. These are just helpful scripts that I feel comfortable sharing.

 code_audit - Poor man's tools for automating code auditing tasks
 
 CTFs - Scripts used for silly CTFs
 
 EMLs - Scripts for manipulating EMLs
 
 mimetype - Scripts to convert between Linux and OSX magic libraries
 
 samples - Algorithm for identifying obfuscated text
 
 URLs - Scripts for manipulating or working with URLs
 
 VirtualBox - An implementation of the VirtualBox API. Most of their API is undocumented, so this was fun.
 
 VirusTotal - Google gives you scripts for interacting with the VirusTotal API, but these are post-processing scripts.
 
 work_samples - These are blogs or writeups of cool projects. These are either sanitized, public, or no longer applicable, so I feel comfortable sharing as evidence of quality work product.
